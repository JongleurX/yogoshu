          #{I18n.t(lang).capitalize} is the source language for this glossary so terms in this language can't be blank and must be unique.
  - if manager?

      %p.help-block
        As a manager, you can set the user for entries, but generally
        it's best to leave this so that the entry is set to the user who
        created it.
  = entry.text_area :info, "Usage information", :class => "input-xxlarge", :rows => 3 do
    %p.help-block
      Usage information is viewable by all users.
  = entry.text_area :note, "Translator notes", :class => "input-xxlarge", :rows => 3 do
    %p.help-block
      Translator notes are only viewable to logged-in users.
